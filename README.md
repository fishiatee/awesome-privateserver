## Contributing

You can contribute to this list by adding new entries to it, correcting mistakes, or simply just tidying things up. 

The goal of this list is to become a comprehensive catalog of everything private server related, however there are some standards for software to be accepted, notably:
* They must be free to access with source code publicly available
* They must be **unofficial** server implementations
* They must at the very least have some degree of functionality (e.g., partial or full reimplementation of core mechanics)

In short, the main list prioritizes quality software that is reputable, feature-rich and well-documented.

Barebones, closed source, and/or rebranded projects are likely to not be accepted into this list as to not bloat it. If one or more projects hold enough significance to warrant their addition, they may be considered to be added to the [Extras](EXTRAS.md) list instead.

Paid and/or gatekept software will never be accepted.

When adding entries, you should reference how existing ones are written to ensure consistency and accuracy.

If you want to suggest anything, feel free to [create an issue](https://github.com/fishiatee/awesome-privateserver/issues/new); or better yet, [open a pull request](https://github.com/fishiatee/awesome-privateserver/compare)!
